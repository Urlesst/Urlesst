Welcome to my profile! I'm Urlesst, though my friends call me Kevin. I'm a data science student, a waifu lover, and a math enthusiast. I code in my free time, but I often forget to upload my projects and sometimes lose them on my desktop xD.

- Programming languages I know: **C++, Java, Python, JavaScript (with Node.js), C**
  
- Moving from **Arch Linux** to **Debian** (Arch has broken on me 5 times already ðŸ—¿).
  
- Character in my pfp: **Firefly - Honkai Star Rail**.

- Full pfp: [here!](https://github.com/urlesst/urlesst/blob/main/fire%20wall.jpg)

And no, HTML is __NOT__ a programming language. **Cheers!**.
